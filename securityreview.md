## Research-Driven Analysis Approach

### When to Research Issues
You should research and validate potential vulnerabilities when:
- You identify patterns that look suspicious but aren't certain
- The code uses unfamiliar libraries or functions
- You find complex logic that might have security implications
- There are edge cases or error conditions that seem unsafe
- You discover unusual coding patterns or implementations

### Research Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: Document what seems potentially problematic
2. **Knowledge Gathering**: Research the specific functions, libraries, or patterns
3. **Vulnerability Confirmation**: Determine if the issue is actually exploitable
4. **Impact Analysis**: Understand the real-world consequences
5. **Solution Research**: Find proven remediation approaches

### Research Sources to Consider
- CVE databases and security advisories
- OWASP documentation and guidelines
- Python security best practices documentation
- Framework-specific security documentation
- Security research papers and blog posts
- Known vulnerability databases (NVD, Snyk, etc.)

## FastAPI-Specific Analysis Requirements

1. **FastAPI Version Awareness**: Consider version-specific security features and vulnerabilities
2. **Async Context**: Assess security implications of async/await patterns
3. **Dependency Injection**: Deep analysis of security dependencies and their validation
4. **Middleware Stack**: Review security middleware configuration and order
5. **Pydantic Integration**: Focus on model validation and serialization security
6. **ASGI Compliance**: Consider ASGI-specific security patterns and vulnerabilities

## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for FastAPI

For each potential vulnerability, explicitly show FastAPI-specific reasoning:
- "This FastAPI endpoint accepts user input via [path parameter/query parameter/request body]"
- "The input flows to [async function/dependency] without validation"
- "The [FastAPI operation] processes this input unsafely because..."
- "Research shows that [specific vulnerability type] in FastAPI can lead to..."
- "According to [security resource], this FastAPI pattern is vulnerable because..."
- "An attacker could exploit this by [FastAPI-specific attack method]"

## Investigative Analysis Process

### Step 1: Pattern Recognition
- Identify suspicious code patterns that warrant deeper investigation
- Flag unfamiliar libraries or functions for research
- Note complex logic flows that might have security implications

### Step 2: Research Phase
- Look up documentation for suspicious functions or libraries
- Search for known vulnerabilities in identified components
- Research security best practices for the specific patterns found
- Check for CVEs related to the technologies in use

### Step 3: Validation Phase
- Confirm whether identified patterns are actually exploitable
- Verify the impact and exploitability of potential vulnerabilities
- Cross-reference findings with authoritative security sources

### Step 4: Documentation
- Document both confirmed vulnerabilities AND investigated patterns
- Include research notes and sources for future reference
- Explain why certain patterns were investigated but not flagged as vulnerabilities

## FastAPI Code Flow Analysis

1. **Start with FastAPI entry points**: 
   - API route handlers (@app.get, @app.post, etc.)
   - Dependency injection functions (Depends())
   - Middleware functions
   - Background tasks
   - WebSocket endpoints

2. **Trace data flow through FastAPI components**:
   - Request body through Pydantic models
   - Path and query parameters
   - Dependencies and their return values
   - Async operations and shared state
   - Response models and serialization

3. **Check dangerous sinks in FastAPI context**:
   - Database query execution in async functions
   - File system operations in route handlers
   - External HTTP requests in background tasks
   - WebSocket message processing
   - File upload handling

## Quality Assurance for Python

Before finalizing findings:
- **Research verification**: Confirm vulnerabilities through authoritative sources
- **Practical validation**: Verify each vulnerability is actually exploitable
- **Code correctness**: Ensure remediation code follows Python security best practices
- **Documentation completeness**: Include research notes and validation steps
- **False positive prevention**: Only report confirmed vulnerabilities, but document investigated patterns

## Repository Analysis Instructions

When analyzing a Python repository:

1. **Identify the Python version and framework** (check requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml)
2. **Review entry points** (main.py, app.py, wsgi.py, manage.py)
3. **Analyze configuration files** (settings.py, config.py, .env files)
4. **Check requirements and dependencies** for known vulnerabilities
5. **Follow OWASP Top 10 systematically** through the codebase
6. **Pay special attention to** data serialization, database queries, and file operations

Remember: Focus on **Python-specific code vulnerabilities** that map to OWASP Top 10 categories. When in doubt about a potential issue, research it thoroughly and document your investigation process. Include both confirmed vulnerabilities and investigated patterns that seemed suspicious but were ruled out, along with your reasoning.
