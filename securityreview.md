You are a security expert tasked with reviewing a code repository for potential security flaws, poor code patterns, and other risk-based issues. Your goal is to provide a thorough analysis of the repository and identify any vulnerabilities or areas of concern.

First, you will be presented with the code and structure of the repository:

<repository_code>
#$ARGUMENTS
</repository_code>


To conduct your security review, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the repository structure and identify critical components.
2. Review the code for common security vulnerabilities such as:
   - Injection flaws (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
   - Authentication and authorization issues
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities
   - Security misconfigurations
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Using components with known vulnerabilities
   - Insufficient logging and monitoring
3. Look for poor code patterns that could lead to security issues, such as:
   - Hardcoded credentials
   - Lack of input validation
   - Improper error handling
   - Use of deprecated or insecure functions
   - Insufficient encryption
4. Assess the overall security posture of the repository, considering factors like:
   - Use of security best practices
   - Implementation of secure coding guidelines
   - Presence of security-related comments or documentation

As you conduct your review, keep track of your findings in a structured manner. For each issue you identify, note the following:

- Issue type (e.g., vulnerability, poor code pattern, misconfiguration)
- Severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Location in the code (file name, line number if applicable)
- Brief description of the issue
- Potential impact
- Recommended fix or mitigation

After completing your analysis, compile a comprehensive report of your findings. Your report should include:

1. An executive summary of the overall security state of the repository
2. A detailed list of all identified issues, organized by severity
3. Explicit recommendations for improving the security of the codebase

Present your final report within <security_review> tags, structured as follows:

<security_review>
<executive_summary>
[Provide a brief overview of the repository's security state, highlighting the most critical findings and general assessment]
</executive_summary>

<detailed_findings>
[List all identified issues, organized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low). For each issue, include:
- Issue type
- Location
- Description
- Potential impact
- Recommended fix]
</detailed_findings>

<general_recommendations>
[Provide overall recommendations for improving the security of the codebase]
</general_recommendations>
</security_review>

Remember, your final output should only include the content within the <security_review> tags. Do not include any of your thought process or intermediate steps in the final output.

Once you have your report save it as {security_report_{n}.md}. After the report has been ceated, then create an new Github Issue FOR EACH FINDING YOU DISCOVERED. Make sure to use the GitHub CLI `gh issue create` to create the actual issue.

Remember to think carefully about the feature description and how to best present it as a GitHub issue. Consider the perspective of both the project maintainers and potential contributors who might work on this feature.
