description: "Create comprehensive documentation suite using 5 parallel technical writer agents"
---

We need to create a series of documentations for the client. We want to create documentation for all of the security, reliability, and scalability work that has been done on the refactor branch of this application. The client is looking for a full suite of documentation for internal use amongst all of the work that we have done. We must use 5 technical writer agents in parallel so that we are able to save time and resources. Use the following format for documentation:

<documentation>
1. Executive Summary
   - Brief overview of the refactor project and its main objectives relating to this documents domain

2. Security Updates
   - Detailed explanations of each security update
   - Rationale behind the changes
   - Implementation details
   - Testing and verification procedures

3. Reliability Improvements
   - Comprehensive list of reliability enhancements
   - Explanation of how each improvement addresses previous issues
   - Technical details of implementations
   - Before and after comparisons (if applicable)

4. Scalability Enhancements
   - Detailed description of scalability improvements
   - Architectural changes to support scalability
   - Performance metrics and benchmarks
   - Capacity planning recommendations

5. Integration and Dependencies
   - List of new tools, libraries, or services introduced
   - Integration points with existing systems
   - Potential impact on other parts of the application

6. Testing and Verification
   - Test plans for new features and improvements
   - Instructions for reproducing test scenarios
   - Key metrics to monitor

7. Future Considerations
   - Identified areas for future improvements
   - Potential challenges or limitations of the current implementation

8. Appendices
   - Glossary of terms
   - Reference documentation for new tools or libraries
   - Detailed code snippets or configuration examples
